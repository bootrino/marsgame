Chapter 1: Arrival

The year is 2147. You are the sole astronaut sent to investigate Outpost Epsilon, a research base on Mars that mysteriously went silent years ago. The crew's last transmission was garbled and filled with static, leaving more questions than answers. No one knows what happened, and now it's your mission to uncover the truth.

Your shuttle lands softly on the Martian surface near the base. As you step out, the vast emptiness of Mars stretches out around you, silent and desolate. The base, once a beacon of human exploration, now stands before you, its walls weathered and coated with red dust. The large, metallic airlock is slightly ajar, a faint, intermittent light visible through the gap.

You’re alone—or so you think.

What do you do?
open the door
ChatGPT

You take a deep breath, steadying your nerves, and approach the slightly ajar airlock door. The metallic surface is cold to the touch, and it creaks as you push it open further. The flickering light inside casts eerie shadows along the corridor, but you step inside anyway, determined to find out what happened here.

The airlock seals shut behind you with a heavy thud, and the interior lights hum to life, though many are dim or malfunctioning. The air inside smells stale, a mix of metal and something faintly decayed. The corridor ahead is narrow, with walls lined with equipment and storage lockers. A low hum vibrates through the floor, indicating that some systems in the base are still operational.

Ahead of you, the corridor splits into two directions:

    To the left, you see a sign indicating "Command Center."
    To the right, a sign reads "Living Quarters."

The flickering light seems to be coming from down the left corridor, while the right corridor disappears into shadow.

What do you do?
go right
ChatGPT

You decide to head down the right corridor toward the Living Quarters. The shadows seem to deepen as you move away from the faint light of the entryway, your footsteps echoing softly in the confined space. The walls here are covered in dust, and you notice scuff marks on the floor, as if something—or someone—had been dragged along the corridor.

The farther you go, the darker it gets, until you find yourself relying on the small light on your suit to illuminate the path ahead. The corridor bends slightly, and you see several doors on either side, each labeled with the name of a crew member. Most of the doors are closed, but one at the end of the hallway is slightly ajar, a faint light spilling out into the darkness.

As you approach the door, you notice the nameplate: Dr. A. Carter - Chief Scientist. The door creaks as you push it open, revealing a small, cluttered living space. Papers and data pads are scattered across the desk, and the bed is unmade, as if someone left in a hurry.

On the desk, you spot an old, flickering terminal. The screen shows the last few entries of a personal log, but it’s locked behind a passcode. Next to the terminal, a small photo of Dr. Carter with a few colleagues catches your eye, all of them smiling—seemingly oblivious to the fate that awaited them.

What do you do?
search the room
ChatGPT

You decide to search the room, hoping to find clues about what happened here—and perhaps the passcode for the terminal.

You start with the desk. The papers and data pads scattered across it seem to be research notes, though much of the writing is disjointed and hastily scribbled. Some pages are filled with complex equations and diagrams, while others contain what looks like journal entries, detailing Dr. Carter's growing unease in the weeks leading up to the base's last transmission.

As you sift through the papers, you find a small notebook tucked under a pile of documents. Flipping through it, you see that it's filled with personal notes, many of which mention strange occurrences—equipment malfunctioning for no apparent reason, strange noises at night, and a growing sense of paranoia among the crew. Toward the end of the notebook, there's a series of numbers written in a different color ink: 4827. It looks like it might be a code.

You pocket the notebook and move to the bedside table. Inside the drawer, you find a small collection of personal items—a pocket watch, a worn book, and a crumpled piece of paper with more scribbled notes. The notes are almost illegible, but you can make out a few words: "The lights… flickering… shadows moving… not alone…"

You glance around the room again, noticing a faint, almost imperceptible sound—a soft, rhythmic tapping, like the distant echo of footsteps. It seems to be coming from somewhere beyond the wall.

You turn back to the terminal, the code 4827 fresh in your mind.

What do you do?
use the terminal
ChatGPT

You approach the terminal, the faint glow of its screen casting a dim light across the desk. The prompt for the passcode blinks steadily, waiting for your input. You enter the numbers from the notebook: 4827.

For a moment, nothing happens, and you wonder if the code is wrong. Then, the terminal beeps, and the screen shifts to reveal Dr. Carter’s personal logs. The latest entries are displayed first. You begin reading:

Log Entry - Date: 2147-03-15

“Things are getting worse. The anomalies we’ve been studying—what started as small fluctuations in the power grid have escalated into something we can’t explain. The lights flicker constantly, and the shadows… I’m not sure if it’s my mind playing tricks on me, but it feels like they’re moving, even when I’m still. The others have noticed it too. We tried to contact Earth again today, but the communication systems are down. We’re completely isolated.”

Log Entry - Date: 2147-03-17

“I heard it again last night. That tapping sound. It’s coming from somewhere deep within the base, but every time I try to track it down, it stops. When I mentioned it to the others, they just stared at me, their eyes… hollow. I don’t think we’re alone here. But that’s impossible. We’re the only ones on Mars. Aren’t we?”

Log Entry - Date: 2147-03-20

“This might be my last entry. The power is failing more frequently, and I can’t shake the feeling that something is watching us. Yesterday, I found Greg in the mess hall, just standing there, staring at the wall, mumbling something I couldn’t understand. When I approached, he didn’t even react. It’s like he wasn’t there anymore. I’m scared. If anyone finds this… please, send help. But more importantly, find out what we’ve awakened.”

As you finish reading the last entry, the tapping sound you noticed earlier grows louder, more distinct. It’s coming from the wall opposite the desk. The sound is irregular, like someone—or something—is trying to communicate or break through.

Suddenly, the terminal screen flickers, and a new message appears on the screen:

“You shouldn’t have come here.”

The room plunges into darkness, the terminal shutting off completely. The tapping stops, replaced by an eerie silence that hangs in the air, thick and oppressive.

What do you do?
turn on the light
ChatGPT

Your heart pounds as the room is swallowed by darkness. Fumbling slightly, you reach for the light controls on your suit. With a flick of your wrist, the helmet light beams to life, cutting through the oppressive blackness.

The room is bathed in the stark, artificial light from your suit. The shadows that once danced at the edges of your vision are gone, replaced by the cold reality of the abandoned living quarters. The bed, the desk, the scattered papers—they’re all just as they were before the terminal went dark. But something feels different. The air seems thicker, more oppressive, as if the darkness itself is pressing in on you.

You shine your light toward the wall where the tapping had come from. The metal surface is scratched and worn, but there’s nothing immediately unusual about it. You approach cautiously, your light sweeping across the room as you go, half expecting something to leap out of the shadows.

When you reach the wall, you notice a small vent near the floor that you hadn’t seen before. The cover is slightly ajar, and the tapping had been coming from within. Kneeling down, you inspect the vent more closely. A faint draft of cool, stale air brushes against your face, carrying with it a faint, almost imperceptible scent—something organic, something… rotten.

The vent is just large enough for you to fit through, though it would be a tight squeeze. It seems to lead deeper into the base, possibly to areas that aren’t on the standard maps.

What do you do?
i'm going to look for a robot to send down the vent
ChatGPT

Deciding that it’s too risky to venture into the unknown vent yourself, you resolve to find a robot or drone that can be sent down instead. Most bases like this one would have maintenance bots or scouting drones designed for tight spaces and hazardous conditions.

You exit Dr. Carter’s room, your suit’s light cutting through the dark corridor. The silence of the base is almost suffocating, broken only by the soft hum of the life support systems still struggling to function. You make your way back down the corridor, passing the other sealed living quarters, and head towards the area where maintenance bots are typically stored.

After a few minutes of cautious exploration, you come across a sign pointing to the "Maintenance Bay." Following the sign, you find yourself at a reinforced door. The keypad next to it is still active, though covered in a thin layer of Martian dust.

The door slides open with a mechanical hiss as you key in the override code. The Maintenance Bay is dimly lit, with various tools and robotic equipment scattered around. In the center of the room, you see a small maintenance drone, about the size of a large briefcase, perched on a charging dock. It’s designed for navigating tight spaces and conducting repairs—perfect for exploring the vent.

You approach the drone and check its status. Fortunately, it seems to be fully operational, though its battery is low. You connect it to a nearby terminal, bringing up its control interface. After a quick diagnostic, the drone’s cameras activate, showing a live feed of the room.

You program the drone to enter the vent in Dr. Carter’s quarters, setting it to transmit a live feed back to your suit’s display. As the drone’s systems whir to life, it hovers slightly off the ground, awaiting your command.

What do you do?
tell the robot to enter the vent
ChatGPT

You input the command, and the maintenance drone hovers slightly higher, its small thrusters humming softly as it moves toward the vent. You follow it back down the dimly lit corridor to Dr. Carter’s quarters, your suit’s display now showing the live feed from the drone’s camera.

Once inside the room, the drone approaches the vent with precision. Its small mechanical arms extend, easily prying the vent cover open the rest of the way. The drone hovers for a moment at the entrance of the vent, its camera peering into the darkness beyond.

You give the final command, and the drone begins its descent into the narrow passageway. The feed on your display shifts to show the inside of the vent—a long, metal tunnel that seems to stretch on into the depths of the base. Dust and debris line the edges, but otherwise, it appears relatively intact.

As the drone moves deeper, the light from its onboard lamps illuminates the narrow space. The vent twists and turns, occasionally branching off into other, smaller ducts. You guide the drone carefully, following the main passage.

After several meters, the drone’s camera picks up something unusual—a bundle of wires, torn and frayed, hanging loosely from the ceiling of the vent. The wires are covered in some kind of dark, sticky residue that glistens in the drone’s light.

Continuing past the wires, the drone reaches a small chamber where the vent widens. The walls here are scorched, as if something had caused an intense heat or fire. The camera picks up more of the dark residue splattered across the surfaces. In the center of the chamber, there’s a small, dark object lying motionless on the floor of the vent. The drone moves closer, and the feed reveals what appears to be… a human hand, severed cleanly at the wrist, lying among the debris.

The sight sends a chill down your spine. Whatever happened here, it wasn’t a simple malfunction.

Before you can react further, the drone’s sensors pick up movement. The feed flickers, and the camera swings around to focus on the far end of the chamber. There, just beyond the range of the light, something shifts in the darkness—an indistinct shape, moving quickly, retreating deeper into the vent system.

The drone’s feed flickers again, and you lose contact for a moment. When the image returns, the chamber is still. The shape is gone, but the unsettling silence remains.

What do you do?
tell the drone to come backl
ChatGPT

You quickly input the command to recall the drone, your heart racing as you watch the live feed. The drone hesitates for a moment, then obediently turns around and begins retracing its path back through the vent system.

As the drone moves through the narrow tunnels, you keep a close eye on the feed, half-expecting to see that mysterious shape reappear. The vent walls slide by, and you notice the dark residue on the wires again as the drone passes them. The silence is thick, broken only by the soft whirring of the drone's thrusters.

Finally, after what feels like an eternity, the drone reaches the entrance of the vent in Dr. Carter’s quarters. It hovers there for a moment, then emerges back into the room. The familiar surroundings of the quarters are a relief, but the sense of unease lingers.

The drone hovers quietly in front of you, its mission complete. The live feed on your display shows nothing but the room around you, but the memory of what it saw in the vents is hard to shake. That severed hand, the dark residue, and whatever was lurking in the shadows… it’s clear that something went terribly wrong here.

What do you do?
go to the command centre
ChatGPT

Deciding that the answers you need might be found in the Command Center, you leave Dr. Carter’s quarters and head back down the dim corridor. The unsettling discoveries you’ve made so far weigh heavily on your mind, but you push forward, determined to uncover the truth.

The base is eerily quiet, with only the sound of your footsteps and the occasional creak of old metal breaking the silence. You reach the intersection where you first entered and turn toward the left corridor, where the sign indicated the Command Center.

As you move down the corridor, the lights become more sporadic, flickering weakly as if the power is failing. The air feels heavier here, thick with dust and an underlying scent of something metallic. The walls are lined with outdated equipment, most of it covered in a fine layer of red Martian dust.

Finally, you reach the reinforced door labeled “Command Center.” The door is slightly ajar, much like the one you encountered earlier at the airlock, as if someone—or something—left in a hurry. You carefully push the door open and step inside.

The Command Center is a large room filled with rows of consoles, screens, and communication equipment. Most of the screens are either dark or displaying static, but a few still show faint, erratic readings—life support, power distribution, and environmental controls. In the center of the room is a large table with a holographic map of the base, though it’s flickering on and off, making it difficult to see the full layout.

As you move deeper into the room, you notice signs of a struggle: overturned chairs, scattered papers, and a strange, dark smear across the floor leading to one of the consoles. The smear resembles the residue you saw in the vent.

One of the consoles near the back of the room is still active, displaying a blinking cursor on a mostly blank screen. It appears to be the main control terminal for the base’s systems. If any logs or data survived, they would likely be accessible from here.

What do you do?
examine the room
ChatGPT

You take a moment to examine the Command Center more thoroughly, hoping to piece together what happened here.

First, you approach the large table in the center of the room, where the flickering holographic map of the base catches your attention. The map shows the layout of Outpost Epsilon, though parts of it blink in and out of existence due to the failing power. You can make out several key areas: the Command Center, Living Quarters, Research Labs, Maintenance Bay, and an area marked "Containment." The Containment section seems to be deep within the base, accessible only through a series of heavily secured corridors.

Next, you turn your attention to the console with the dark smear on the floor. The residue is thick and almost tar-like, similar to what you saw in the vent. It leads directly to the console, as if someone or something was dragged here. You inspect the console itself, but it appears to have been forcibly shut down, with wires hanging loosely from its underside, torn and frayed.

Moving to the other side of the room, you notice a storage locker that’s been left open. Inside, you find a variety of emergency supplies—medical kits, flares, and what looks like an old, but functional, portable power unit. You take the power unit with you, thinking it might come in handy if the base’s systems fail completely.

As you continue your search, you come across a small, handheld device lying on the floor near one of the communication consoles. It’s a portable data recorder, slightly damaged but still operational. You pick it up and see that it contains several recorded messages. Most are garbled or corrupted, but one message, marked as "urgent," stands out. You decide to play it:

"This is Dr. A. Carter. If anyone finds this, you need to know that the base was conducting experiments we were never briefed on. They... they found something in the Martian soil. Something ancient. It's... alive. We tried to contain it, but it got out. The crew... it's not them anymore. I think I'm the only one left. Please, if you receive this, do not attempt to recover us. Destroy the base. Don't let it leave Mars."

The message ends abruptly, the last few words drowned out by static. The device falls silent in your hand, leaving you alone with the weight of what you’ve just heard.

Finally, you return to the main control terminal at the back of the room. The blinking cursor on the screen seems to beckon you, inviting you to access whatever data might still be stored here. This terminal likely controls the base’s remaining systems and could hold logs, camera footage, or other critical information.

ideas:

cards for objects?

a mind forever voyaging style play

seeing things you need to do and needing to send a robot to do it
example looking out of a window and seeing a problem in the distance


don't just "wake up from cryosleep" make the first problem or situation happen in cryosleep

have another base nearby perhaps from another nation
make communication or lack of communication a puzzle

robots with different specialities

cameras

mars life found and thriving in the food production facilities

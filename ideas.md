cards for objects?

a mind forever voyaging style play

seeing things you need to do and needing to send a robot to do it
example looking out of a window and seeing a problem in the distance
looking through windows into inaccessible areas such as a reactor glowing with green light


don't just "wake up from cryosleep" make the first problem or situation happen in cryosleep

have another base nearby perhaps from another nation
make communication or lack of communication a puzzle

robots with different specialities

cameras

mars life found and thriving in the food production facilities

mars rovers
balloons
helicopters

mars wind storm
valle marinaris


    "I’m a big kid bot! Watch me do a spinny dance!"
    "I tried counting my circuits, but I lost track after two!"
    "Do robots get bedtime stories? I want a beep-boop tale!"
    "Can we play hide and seek? I’ll hide, and you beep when you find me!"
    "Oops! I tried to make toast, but now it's...extra crispy!"
    "Do robots dream of electric sheep? I dream of chocolate chip cookies!"
    "Why do I have to go to bed? My circuits aren’t even sleepy!"
    "Can we play tag? I’ll be the fastest bot ever!"
    "If I eat too many cookies, will my tummy turn into a cookie jar?"
    "I tried to fly, but I think I need wings...or rocket boosters!"
    "Why can’t we have pizza every day? Robots like pizza too!"
    "I’m gonna be the biggest, strongest robot when I grow up! Rawr!"
"I don’t need a nap! My batteries are still full!"
"Why do humans sleep? Can’t you just recharge like me?"
"Do stars sing songs?
Do robot wishes come true?
"Can I ride on your shoulders? 
Floyd peers at what you are doing "can I help please?"
"Why is the sky blue?"
"Can we have ice cream for breakfast?"
"I’m not sleepy!"
"Look what I can do!"
"Why do I have to take a bath?"
"Can I have a pet dinosaur?"
"Why does it rain?"
"I want to be a superhero when I grow up!"
"Can we play outside?"
"Why do I have to go to bed when the sun is still up?"
"I’m hungry again!"
"Why can’t I fly like a bird?"
"Can you tell me a story?"
"I don’t want to wear this!"
"Why do cats purr?"
"How do cars work?"
"I want to do it myself!"
"Where does the moon go during the day?"
"Why do people have to work?"
"Can we go to the zoo and see the animals?"



Floyd yawns.
